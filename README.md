# LCNC Skill Landscape – Interactive Cluster Visualizations

This repository contains a small static web project with interactive visualizations of clustering results from a systematic literature analysis on Low-Code/No-Code (LCNC) platforms.

The visualizations support the exploration of skill and competency structures relevant to citizen developers in corporate and public-sector contexts.

## Visualizations

- **Semantic Tree (Sunburst)**  
  Hierarchical view of meta-clusters, clusters, and keywords with relative frequencies.

- **Collapsible Tree (D3)**  
  Expandable tree for interactive inspection of clusters, including cluster size and keyword counts.

## Usage

Open `index.html` locally or host the repository via GitHub Pages.  
Each visualization can be opened in a separate browser tab.

## Notes

This repository focuses on visualization only.  
Underlying data, literature sources, and clustering code are not included.
