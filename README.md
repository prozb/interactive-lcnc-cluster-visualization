# LCNC Skill Landscape – Interactive Cluster Visualizations

This repository contains a small static web project with interactive visualizations of clustering results from a systematic literature analysis on Low-Code/No-Code (LCNC) platforms.

The visualizations support the exploration of skill and competency structures relevant to citizen developers in corporate and public-sector contexts.
